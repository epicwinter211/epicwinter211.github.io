<h2 class="bold">What is it?</h2>
<p>The factories game is a game that I am trying to make in unity.</p>
<p>It is based off of a game that I play called factorio.</p>
<p>Factorio is a game where you build factories and automate things, and I want my game to be factorio meets minecraft, or a 3D factorio.</p>
