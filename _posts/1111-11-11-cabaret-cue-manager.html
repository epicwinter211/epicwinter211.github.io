<h2 class="bold">What is it?</h2>
<p>The cabaret cue manager is a project that I worked on for a cabaret that I am participating in.</p>
<p>It is supposed to compile a few videos into one, and you can cue them into a fullscreen video.</p>
<p>How it works is, you upload a few videos, then you click 'compile video'. This should bring you into a fullscreen video.</p>
<p>In the fullscreen video, you can press space to cue the next video. To edit it or to go out of fullscreen, press escape.</p>
<p>To reset the video, press 'reset video'. This will delete all the videos. To add a video, press 'add video'.</p>

<p>The cue manager can be found here:</p>
