<h2 class="bold">What is it?</h2>
<p>The web platformer is a game that I am trying to create with pure js and a canvas.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to see how far I can get without using an engine like phaser.</p>
<p>I have made an engine that will take a tilemap and put it on the page, and you can collide with blocks.</p>
<p>It is a little buggy, where you sometimes can jump into a wall. The keys to move are WASD.</p>
<p>I looked at scratch, a game maker that I started learning to code in, and used a physics engine from that.</p>
<p>It surprisingly worked well!</p>

<p>The web platformer game can be found here:</p>
