<h2 class="bold">What is it?</h2>
<p>Ghost mansion is my first minecraft minigame I have made.
It is a multiplayer game. You play it by typing:</p>
<div class="code">/start</div>
<p>If you are a ghost hunter, the objective is to shine your flashlight
on the ghost. If you are the ghost, the objective is to scare all the 
players (or walk into them.)</p>
<p>You are timed as the ghost tries to get you. If the ghost doesnt get
you in time, the players win. If the ghost scares all the players, the
ghost wins.</p>
<p>To download it, click <a href="https://github.com/eoriont/GhostMansion/raw/master/jar/GhostMansion.jar">
  here</a>.</p>
<p>The config file holds some variables. The config looks like this:</p>
<div class="code">delayToStart: 20
  delayNewGameStart: 20
  autoStart: true
  serverName: §b§lCycle§aMC
  messageDelay: 300
</div>
<p>The <div class="code">delayToStart: 20</div> means how long the game
will wait when it is counting down (in seconds)</p>
<p>The <div class="code">delayNewGameStart: 20</div> means how long the
game will take when it is autostarting the game. This variable won't
matter if you set autoStart to false.</p>
<p><div class="code">autoStart: true</div> sets if the game will automatically
start or not once a game ends.</p>
<p>The variable <div class="code">serverName: §b§lCycle§aMC</div> is the
name of your server. It uses minecraft color codes.</p>
