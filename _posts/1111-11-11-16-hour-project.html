<h2 class="bold">What is it?</h2>
<p>The 16 Hour Project is a project that I am working on in school right now.</p>
<p>For it, I am coding a line calculator. You can draw a line and it will spit out the equation for it using y=mx+b</p>
<p>I am using mathjax, a js library for beautifying math, and especially fractions.<p>

<p>The 16 hour project can be found here:</p>
